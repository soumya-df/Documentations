This contains some Quick Actions **Create An Agent, Open Playground** or **Connect To A Database**. 

Or you can directly start a chat by writing in the message box, and selecting an agent by clicking on the dropdown (button) in left side of the message box and click on send button  (button) in the right side of the bar. For example here we ask “I want to know the sales and the order volume for different regions”.
